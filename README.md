# LTE Handover Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a simulation of LTE handover mechanisms, focusing on the decision-making process for handover events based on signal strength and network conditions. The simulation models key LTE parameters such as frequency, transmission power, MIMO configurations, and carrier aggregation.

## Features
- Simulates LTE network parameters including frequency bands, transmission power, and coding rates.
- Implements a handover decision algorithm based on RSRP, RSRQ, and RSSI.
- Incorporates hysteresis and event thresholds to model realistic handover conditions.
- Visualizes handover events and signal quality trends using Matplotlib.

## Installation
To run the simulation, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the simulation:

```bash
jupyter notebook lte_handover_simulation.ipynb
```

## File Structure
- `lte_handover_simulation.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the simulation code and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Documentation and usage instructions.

## Example Plots
The simulation generates visualizations of signal strength variations and handover events. Sample plots include:
- RSRP variation over time.
- Handover decisions based on predefined thresholds.
